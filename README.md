It's a parody Mommy blog I set up for my wife.  Check out the illustrations, they are far more interesting than any code you will find in this repo.

As a matter of fact, probability is high there is absolutely nothing of value for you here, just a free spot to store my code incase I lose my laptop.

Tah tah,
